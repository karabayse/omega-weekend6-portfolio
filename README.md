Objectives

Angular practice with:
- [X] multiple views,
- [X] controllers, and a
- [X] service

- [X] Front end styling
- [] Hosting without a database on Heroku

Instructions

- [X] Create a landing page for yourself as a developer.
     This is a front end project, it has a simple server set up to serve back your
     static files. Otherwise, the focus will be on Angular and front end styling.


Front End

- [X] Have at least two views: One page about you and one page about your code.
- [X] One view about you that uses some info from the Github Profile API call
- [X] One view about your code that uses info from the Github Repo API call.
- [X] Use the GithubAPI service to interact with the GitHub API.
- [X] You will need to generate a token assign it to the oauthToken variable.
- [X] Also assign the username variable your GitHub username.

Generate a GitHub Token. Select only public_repo and read:user.
For reference, here is the API Docs for GitHub.
Style your site applying any techniques you want from Friday demos.
Back End

- [X] You have already been given a simple server. You don't need to change the
      code.  As practice, comment each line of code in the server. Make sure you
      know what each line does.
- [X] If you will be deploying this on Heroku, you will need to change the port
     so it isn't hard coded.


Hard Mode

Deploy

- [] Deploy the app on Heroku. It doesn't have a database so you can follow the same steps as we did in lecture.
